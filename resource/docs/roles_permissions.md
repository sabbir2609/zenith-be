### **Additional Considerations:**
- **Role Hierarchy**: You can create a hierarchy of roles where higher-level roles (e.g., Hotel Manager) inherit permissions from lower roles (e.g., Receptionist).
- **Custom Permissions**: You can create custom permissions for specific features, such as access to special services or exclusive areas (e.g., VIP lounge).
- **Permission Granularity**: Permissions can be fine-tuned to control access to specific features (e.g., viewing guest profiles, accessing financial data, etc.).

This dynamic role and permission system ensures that everyone in the hotel has the appropriate level of access to perform their duties while maintaining security and operational efficiency.
